**Documentation for Port Traffic Aggregation and Anomaly Detection System**

**1. Introduction:**
The provided code implements a system for aggregating port-level network traffic statistics and detecting anomalies using an autoencoder-based approach. The system uses an eBPF program to parse network packets, aggregate traffic statistics for each port, and employs a Python script to train an autoencoder and detect anomalies in the aggregated data.

**2. Components:**

**2.1. eBPF Program (port_flow.c):**
The eBPF program is responsible for parsing incoming network packets and aggregating traffic statistics for TCP and UDP flows. It maintains a hash table (`flow_data`) to store per-port flow statistics, including total bytes sent, total packets, average payload size, maximum payload size, and minimum payload size.

**2.2. Python Script (port_flow_aggregation_anomaly_detection.py):**
The Python script utilizes BCC to load and attach the eBPF program, collects flow statistics, trains an autoencoder, and detects anomalies in the aggregated port traffic data. The main functionalities include:

- Initializing and training an autoencoder for anomaly detection.
- Periodically collecting flow statistics from the eBPF program.
- Standardizing and training the autoencoder with collected data at regular intervals.
- Detecting anomalies using the trained autoencoder and sending alerts.

**2.3. Configuration (config.py):**
- `input_dim`: Dimension of the input data for the autoencoder.
- `encoding_dim`: Dimension of the encoded data in the autoencoder.
- `prediction_period`: Interval for collecting port traffic statistics and anomaly detection.
- `training_period`: Interval for training the autoencoder.

**3. Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection:**

**3.1. Autoencoder Initialization:**
- The script initializes an autoencoder model with a specified input and encoding dimension.
- The autoencoder is a neural network with a single hidden layer using the Mean Squared Error loss function.

**3.2. Training the Autoencoder:**
- The script periodically trains the autoencoder using the aggregated port traffic data.
- Training is performed by standardizing the dataset and fitting it to the autoencoder model.
- The autoencoder is trained for a fixed number of epochs.

**3.3. Anomaly Detection:**
- Anomalies are detected by comparing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed data.
- A threshold is set based on the 95th percentile of the MSE during training.
- If the MSE exceeds the threshold, the data point is considered an anomaly.

**4. Execution:**
- The script runs in an infinite loop, periodically collecting and processing port traffic statistics.
- Autoencoder training and anomaly detection occur at specified intervals.
- Anomalies trigger alerts and are sent to a specified endpoint using an HTTP POST request.

**5. Dependencies:**
- The script relies on BCC, NumPy, requests, and Keras. Ensure these dependencies are installed.

**6. Conclusion:**
This system provides an example of using eBPF for real-time traffic aggregation and an autoencoder for anomaly detection in network traffic. Users can adapt and extend the code for specific use cases, such as network monitoring and anomaly detection in port-level traffic.
